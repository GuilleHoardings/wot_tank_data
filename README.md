# WOT tank data
Data about tanks in World of Tanks.

The goal of this repository is to hold the [code to extract data about tanks](wot_csv_extractor.html)
for World of Tanks to a [CSV file](wot_data.csv) and to do some analysis done with data. This is what I have so far:

1. [General analysis](1%20General%20analysis.ipynb)
2. [More coming...]

Pull requests and new ideas are welcomed. If you are interested in more analysis, send me an e-mail
to [guille.hoardings@gmail.com](guille.hoardings@gmail.com).
