        <p>Data about tanks in World of Tanks.</p>

        <p>The goal of this repository is to hold the code to extract data about tanks for World of Tanks to a CSV file
            and
            to do some analysis done with data. This is what I have so far:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="1-General-analysis.html">General analysis</a>
            </li>

            <li>[More coming...]
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Pull requests and new ideas are welcomed. If you are interested in more analysis, send me an e-mail to
            guille.hoardings@gmail.com.</p>
